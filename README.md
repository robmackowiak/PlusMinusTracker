# PlusMinus Tracker

Welcome to the PlusMinus Tracker, a Streamlit web application designed to help you track live plus-minus player and lineup statistics during basketball games for both teams. This app provides real-time insights into the impact of players and lineups on the game while they are on the court. I developed this app as a Performance Analyst for a basketball team and used it live in-game on the bench to help our coaching staff make better decisions about their players and their rotations.

## How to Use

1. **Run the App**: Open the app either by navigating to:

   https://plusminus.streamlit.app/

    or loading the app locally by running this in your Terminal:

    ```bash
    streamlit run live_plus_minus_tracker.py
    ```
